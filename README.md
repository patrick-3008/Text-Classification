# BERT-Based Sarcasm Detection

## Overview
This repository contains a BERT-based model for sarcasm detection in text. The model classifies text as either **sarcastic** or **not sarcastic** using deep learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset should contain labeled text samples with two classes:
- `is_sarcastic = 1` (Sarcastic)
- `is_sarcastic = 0` (Not Sarcastic)

You can use publicly available sarcasm datasets like the **SARC dataset** or Kaggle's **Sarcasm Detection Dataset**.

## Requirements
Install the required dependencies before running the model:

```bash
pip install transformers torch datasets scikit-learn numpy pandas
```

## Model Architecture
The model is based on **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**, fine-tuned for a binary classification task.

- Pretrained **BERT-base-uncased** model from Hugging Face
- Fully connected layer for classification
- Adam loss function

## Results
The model achieves approximately **85-90% accuracy** on benchmark sarcasm datasets.
